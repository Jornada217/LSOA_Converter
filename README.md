# LSOA_Converter
Function using selenium, to parse 2001 LSOAs and convert to 2011 LSOAs


This function is imported to the notebooks, to convert quantity of geostastica files in 2001 LSOAs into 2011 LSOAs.
Selenium is used to parse the files, and Chromium has to be in the destination folder.
Also, this file may crash if updates are made to the GeaoConvert tool website.
This would require reading and updating the HTML indexes.
